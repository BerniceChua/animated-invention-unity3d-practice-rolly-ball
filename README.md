# Animated Invention (Unity3D-practice) Rolly-Ball

## About

A simple game based on the [tutorial in Unity's website](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial), but improved because it has:

1. an intro screen with instructions on how the game controls work (WASD or arrow keys).
2. options to replay the game or quit the game.

In this game, you roll a ball to pick up little spinny-cubes.  You win the game if all the spinny-cubes are picked up.  

This README also contains:

1. things that I wish I knew when I started (that are not in the tutorials).
2. how to download and install Unity3D on Ubuntu.

## How did the name of this project come about?

I was starting a GitHub repo for this Unity3D project, and GitHub recommended the name.  It seems fitting, so I just stuck with it.
